But i should tell you that reagan is Mr. Reagan faced a far tougher challenge than did Mr. Kennedy, whose term was also too short to be definitive.Bobby Kennedy is nominated in '76 wins - screws up even worse than carter -which leads to Reagan and pretty much everything we have now.Kennedy was more conservative then reagan, poppa bush, or W.
