meanwhile , though windows 8 is significantly at greater risk ( 1 . 73 percent ) compared to windows 8 . 1 , according to redmond ' s report , it ' s still significantly safer than windows 7 , windows xp , or windows vista .
windows 7 is still going strong even though the day was about windows 8 , microsoft announced it ' s approaching 450 million copies of windows 7 sold thus far , with windows 7 consumer usage coming in greater than windows xp .
i have tried windows 8 and it ' s lighter than windows xp .
moreover , windows 8 is even lighter on your resources than windows 7 ( but heavier than windows xp , of course ).
that means that for most consumers , choosing a windows 8 product edition is simpler than it ' s been since october 2001 , when microsoft released windows xp in two flavors , windows xp home edition and windows xp professional edition .
whatever the case , enterprises in general will find that upgrading from windows 7 to windows 8 will be significantly simpler and less expensive than upgrading from windows xp to windows 7 , he said .
windows 8 is 21 times and 6 times safer than windows xp and windows 7 respectively .
as per microsoft claims , windows 8 is 6 times safer than windows and 21 times safer than windows xp from a virus infection perspective .
the most secure os ever made : according to microsoft , windows 8 is 21 times safer than windows xp , and 6 times safer than windows 7 , from a malware infection perspective .
however , we ' re sure at least on one point now that the new windows 8 password features won ' t make windows 8 password safer than the traditional text password in windows xp .
but that aside , windows 10 is still easier to navigate than mac os x and windows 8 , has better access to files than in android , and is faster , more flexible and more capable than windows xp and the home and enterprise editions of windows 7 .
actually , from things i ' ve seen , windows 8 requires less of the hardware than windows 7 ( runs faster / leaner than windows 7 on the same hardware ) and windows 7 runs as good as ( or better than ) windows xp .
firstly , windows 8 runs faster than windows xp absolutely .
windows 8 is faster than windows xp or windows 7 .
this makes windows 8 sales 34 % better than windows vista , and about 15 % higher than windows xp .
" but windows xp systems had an infection rate that was six times higher than windows 8 ."
the malware infection rate for windows xp is already almost six times higher than windows 8 systems .
windows 8 devices also come in more form factors , so you could find that a windows 8 tablet with touch is far easier to use than your old windows xp machine .
the touch - friendly windows 8 software is much better at juggling work and play than windows xp tablet pc edition .
i ' d suggest windows 8 as it ' s build with touch in mind , and it ' s much better than windows 7 and windows xp when using a touch interface .
windows 8 and 8 . 1 both gain users , but still can ' t touch windows xp , even combined
windows 8 makes it harder to use my computer than windows 7 , windows xp ... or even windows vista .
actually for many windows xp users it is easier to migrate to linux mint than to windows 8 .
if you ' re accustomed to the windows xp layout and style , upgrading to windows 7 might be a better choice than windows 8 , martini said .
perhaps it is little wonder that windows xp usage continues to grow faster than that of windows 8 . x .
it is also similar in usability to windows xp , ensuring that the learning curve for new users is relatively smoother than migrating to windows 8 .
in my opinion , transitioning from windows xp or windows 7 to linux mint or ubuntu will be much easier than transitioning to windows 8 or 8 . 1 .
[ the ] start button has gone , all the basic functions have changed , he said , noting that migrating from windows xp to windows 7 would be easier than to windows 8 .
the return of the start menu will be a welcome change for users who were used to windows xp / vista / 7 , and may make windows 10 a bit easier to transition to than windows 8 was .
windows xp hides this deep inside the start menu - all programs / accessories / system tools - but in later versions of windows you can quickly locate it just by typing ' restore ' into the search tool in the start menu or the windows 8 start screen .
true , although i was a windows xp - user before migrating , i had to use windows 7 at work and i hated its start - menu , the search option was annoying , and this menu isn ' t removed in windows 8 , it has just moved to the charms bar .
windows xp share drops while windows 8 and windows 8 . 1 see a combined share of 11 . 3 %
windows 8 . x gains usage share at the expense of windows xp .
by the way , windows xp has 80 % more market share than windows 8 .
seamless login is supported on windows 7 and windows 8 but not on windows xp managed devices in a vmware vdi environment .
optimize existing windows 7 or windows xp applications for touch to provide a good user experience on 2 in 1 devices on windows 8 .
( windows 8 holds about 1 percent share of enterprise computing devices , according to mobile management vendor fiberlink , whereas half still use the 12 - year - old windows xp .)
yeah , mobile devices , tablets , yadda yadda , but look at operating system market share in terms of percentages : windows 8 is lagging behind freaking windows xp .
