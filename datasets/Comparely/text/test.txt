merely saying i think ios has worse multitasking than android is less interesting than a compare / contrast with earlier useful solutions / ios / android .
plus , android is developing a way faster than ios so it has chances to become a laptop replacement earlier than ios .
went to android earlier this year after being convinced its better then ios apple .
the version we showed here is ios only , because the ios code supported ibeacons earlier than android , but we are almost finished with an android one as well .
he ' ll quickly realize why android is a better os - and even simpler to use than ios for most daily tasks .
and when it comes to a os being simple to use , bada is simpler to use than android ( and lots faster too ), but bada still has more functions than ios or wp7 .
that ' s why it ' s so ridiculous to say that ios is simpler to use than android .
in my view , ios is still simpler to use than android , and made even simpler in ios 7 .
as much as i hate to say it , android is not inferior to ios any longer , and they have reached parity .
ios is still good , but no longer is better than android .
this matters very little from a usage point - of - view , but technically this aspect of ios is inferior to android , and provides the illusion of longer battery life .
ios is no longer smoother than android , at least in 4 . 3 jelly bean or 4 . 4 kit kat , especially on the moto x or the new moto droids .
too bad android has been around longer than ios .
android is smarter , leaner , faster , and more capable than ever - and though it currently lacks exciting new features , it ' s still a strong contender against that other mobile heavyweight : ios 7 .
oh and by the way android is smarter than ios .
android is a smarter mobile os choice than ios : 10 reasons why .
try to search for tasker which is only one reason android is much smarter than ios and ios users .
android has its advantages , but overall , it remains significantly easier to write good ios apps than good android apps .
android itself is getting smoother and simpler , but still has a geekier feel than apple ' s ios operating system .
software developers believe google ' s android platform has a better long - term outlook , better technological capabilities , and greater openness than apple ' s ios platform .
to sum up , while the android platform is a somewhat safer choice than apple ' s ios in terms of security and privacy protection , none of the two aforementioned platforms is indeed secure .
here on the af , android is faster than ios and on the apple forums , android is slower .
although , google ' s android is closing the gap in terms of revenue generated and will be doing it faster than apple ' s ios , ios is expected to retain majority of the share for the next 3 - 4 years .
ios users read slower than android , and for shorter periods of time .
android users were always saying how much better android was than ios .
that ' s interesting , as i ' ve noticed many android users posting in this subforum comment that android keyboards , and in particular swiftkey , are superior to ios .
pro - android users argue that android is now better than ios for a myriad of reasons .
consumers of any android device do things faster and better on android than on ios , this has been true since the very first consumer version of android .
android is superior to ios , imo , because it lets consumers be the boss , not steve jobs .
this means that ios apps are not only better than android apps today , they ' re getting better faster than android apps because apple is deploying and the installed base is rapidly upgrading to much more powerful apis on the devices in consumers ' hands .
they were right , my stance has always been that android is superior to ios due to the choices given to consumers .
android is as simple or simpler than ios if you ' re using it superficially which most consumers are doing .
i picked up android alot easier , faster than ios .
android seems faster and smoother than ios , but only on nexus smartphones .
simply put android is easier , better , innovative , developing than ios .
creating an android app is easier and faster than with ios .
and android was designed to be adaptable and is evolving faster and nicer than ios .
standard android based platforms may be easier to implement than the blackberry and ios platforms .
@ kadajawi : technically , qt for ios is not a problem and even easier to implement than for android .
i find ios apps are way smoother and work better than android .
ios is much easier to do , and looks better , than android apps .
ios can run a lot smoother and apps run faster on lesser hardware than a beefed up android device .
the ios ecosystem is a lot nicer in that stuff works and there are more and better apps than on android .
there are more apps on ios , and you might argue that the ios app store is better run and easier to use than the android marketplace .
it ' s like a runner with a lighter backpack ( ios in this case ) running faster than a fitter runner with a heavier backpack ( android here ).
general observations : colors differ slightly between the devices , ios is lighter than android .
in my experience , jailbreaking an ios device is a much , much lighter modification than rooting an android device .
iphone dominates in benchmarks because a ) it is new b ) ios 7 is a much lighter platform than android .
the ios wallet is lighter than the android version in one way : tap - to - pay isn ' t included because it requires nfc support , which isn ' t available on ios devices .
i do agree with the few that think ios apps are nicer ... app store is bigger ... but i also agree android is catching up faster than apple imagined !
yet if you say ios is better than android please , tell why , not just say ouuu the appstore is bigger or it ' s made out of glass and / or metal , or it ' s faster than android phones .
in games that rely more on bigger purchases , ios often performs better than android .
anyway ios looks better than android but android being open source is more versatile usuable and will be able to evolve into bigger and better things .
android is bigger than ios .
its because ios and windows 8 have a better and smoother framework than android .
6 ) ios is a much smoother os , and just works better , much better than the android os .
keep in mind that the ios 4 is more mature , solid , smoother and is easier to use than android .
ios provides a much richer set of both cryptographic and key management infrastructure than android .
ios users are more female and richer than android users , especially when you consider tablets , the more likely buying device .
speaking in london , sheryl sandberg said that android , google ' s mobile operating system , was allowing the company to provide a richer user experience than apple ' s rival ios .
at the outset i must say that the reporting for android apps is much richer and superior than that provided by apple for ios .
if you know the makeup of any of these major cities it is beyond doubt that the average ios user is richer than the average android user .
ios is has a better user experience than android and it is also much easier to develop for .
ios is sooooo much easier to develop for than android .
ios is far easier to develop for than android and we always do ios first .
the survey also found , perhaps unsurprisingly , that developers find both ios and blackberry easier to develop for than android .
" android because it ' s more secure and easier to develop for than ios " .
i think this makes ios devices easier to learn than android devices .
android development is easier to learn than ios , however , once you learn ios , the end result of the apps is by far more impressive than android .
for newbies , the ios experience is easier to learn than any of the various flavors of android os with mfr customizations .
apple ios ( for iphones , ipads , ipod touch ) - some argue that apple ' s touch response is noticeably quicker and smoother than android devices , and this has only improved for the iphone 6 generation , which features sensors on the surface rather than beneath .
there ' s a reason why ios often looks smoother than android even on inferior processing power and that ' s because iphones always have top of the line gpus .
i can fix a typo ... but android still sucks and is inferior to ios and apple and iphones and you can ' t fix that .
ios was the thing that sold iphones over superior spec android handsets .
time was people would argue ios was in a better position than android ( and laugh at people who predicted android would end up beating ios ) because there were more iphones being sold than android devices .
with added security in ios it really feels safer on apple devices than on android devices .
why ios is safer than android .
one reason that ios is safer than android is that bug fixes to the operating system are rolled out faster .
ios apps are generally safer than android apps .
why ios is safer than android the relative vulnerability of android vs . ios comes down to the level of control the vendors have over products and the marketplace for development and distribution of apps .
for me personally , ios is still easier and faster ( and simpler ) to use for everyday living , which is probably why my iphone 5 gets more use than my note 2 but obviously , the customization and freedom is better on android .
for managing devices in the enterprise , however , ios has been far simpler with better capabilities than android by far .
of course , the reactions are priceless , with almost everyone saying ios is better and simpler than android after praising the android - equipped iphone .
for normal people like me ( no geeks wannabe ) ios is simpler , faster , leaner , stable and friendly than android os up to now .
ios is a simpler os in comparison to android .
fuzzier regions like python is easier to read than ruby , stating .
ruby is a bad choice because multiplication seems slower in ruby than in python .
ruby 2 . 1 added a feature to use gmp for large multiplication , but it still seems slower than python 2 . 7 .
i find the python version of that test easier to read , and i ' ve been using ruby almost 10 years longer than python .
i think that python is a lot easier to read than ruby or java .
python is usually fast enough for what you want it to do ( and faster than ruby ), while requires a third of the code of an equivalent java program and is much easier to read .
my primary language , though , is likely to remain python , as i find it about 60 million times easier to read than perl , and 100 million times easier to read than ruby .
performance is the main downfall , with python being somewhat faster than ruby as i understand it .
java has , in some cases , the performance of c ++ or at least half the performance of it , while ruby is ( afair ) 18 times slower than c . python is better , but is not in java territory .
the only things python have going for it are a comprehensive library , better than ruby performance , and mindshare .
it ' s much more widely known , and all the benchmarks i ' ve seen also show python as rather faster than ruby , and django as higher - performance than rails .
arguably , the mature c integration tools available to python make it far better suited to high performance computing than ruby .
the python code appears to be 4 times faster than the ruby code : .
all he ' s saying ( literally ) is that ruby 1 . 8 was in the range of 5 times slower than python 2 . 5 and ruby 1 . 9 is in the range of 3 times faster than python 2 . 5 when running this exact code .
ruby is 1 . 7 times slower than perl , tcl is 3 . 3 times slower , and python is 8 . 2 times slower !
it ' s time to show secret python weapon - calculation of same fibonacci numbers but in 1000 times faster than antonio ' s ruby implementation .
the only drawback i would consider is that ruby is about 10x slower than python ( as far as i know ), due to the lack of a bytecode format .
no bearing on the original topic , and i may just be calling out a typo , but for the record the current python implementation is much faster than the implementations of ruby , perl , or php because it uses java - esque bytecode partial - compilation .
the ruby 1 . 9 interpreter compiles ruby source code into bytecode , which is then executed by the ruby virtual machine , just like python and php .
van rossum : python not much worse than ruby python creator guido van rossum discusses the prospects and criticisms of python , noting that critics of python should supplement with ruby rather than re - engineering python apps into a better language .
i feel python to be an easier language to learn than ruby .
benchmarking languages is an inexact science , but ruby appears drastically slower than even javascript and python .
ruby seem to be slower than python or perl , but faster than .
i know python better than ruby , but i still work much faster with ruby .
for whatever it ' s worth , using your code above , python ( 2 . 6 ) is considerably faster than ruby ( 1 . 8 ) on my machine ... 11 . 7 seconds for python vs . 46 . 7 seconds for ruby .
python is better than ruby , i have no doubt in my mind , but if we let ruby become - faster - than python , people will gravitate away from python .
- i hate ruby , because it ' s slow , even slower than java or python .
i think you ' ll find ruby a cleaner language in general , and it ' s certainly a greater departure from perl than python is .
python has a much greater range of libraries available to it , and most of those libraries are more mature and better documented than their ruby counterparts .
python , overall , has far greater usage than ruby .
my point was that for a dynamic pl , the correctness guaranteed by ruby in not much better than that guaranteed by python ( as frank has pointed out often , and with much greater expressiveness and zeal than i can muster ).
on the other hand , ruby also has much greater syntactic flexibility than python .
when i started learning haskell then some where it was given that because of type checking haskell is faster than python .
what i like best about python ( its ability to be both functional and imperative ) is left a little inferior to haskell because of its lack of the beauty that is the haskell type system .
when i last checked the benchmark game speed comparisons , javascript v8 was slower than most of the explicitly typed and type inference languages like haskell and ocaml , but much faster than other languages without explicit types like python , ruby and perl .
haskell is faster than c ++, more concise than perl , more regular than python , more flexible than ruby , more typeful than c #, more robust than java , and has absolutely nothing in common with php .
update 2007 - 01 - 26 : of course , the python version is not easier to grok than this alternative haskell version : .
mike further demonstrates his ignorance of indentation - based systems by claiming haskell does better than python , because apparently , it ' s all part of the type system .
also , haskell code runs a lot faster than python code ( real native - code compiler that can use multicore hardware ), and there is a clever automatic unit testing system ( quickcheck ) that relies on haskell ' s static type system to generate random tests automatically .
with haskell you ' d being learning a mh - type system , which is a very very different experience than working with python .
the ml family and haskell languages do have an amazing static type system , which provides guarantees that i don ' t have when i program in python .
( the haskell version that uses a better algorithm can be a bit faster than the python version ).
i ' ve no problem with recognizing that haskell is much faster than python and that python is faster than ruby in most scenarios .
scheme , ocaml , haskell , and lisp are all an order of magnitude faster than python .
haskell compiled to native code is typically an order of magnitude faster than python .
-- -- quick implementation by dmwit on # haskell -- faster , shorter , uses less memory than the python version .
it ' s not as declarative as say , haskell , but it ' s friendlier to a broader variety of programs while still having a more declarative feel than python .
you can go ahead and right some code without static type checking in python , and you might even write it faster than you would have in haskell .
part of the power of haskell ( and ml and ada and other language with nice subtyping facilities ) is the ability to declare a subtype of a built in type like integer , instead of having to do manual bounds checking like you would in perl / python / etc .
it is also true that python programs are easier to install than haskell .
hence the haskell is over an order of magnitude slower than most languages and even slower than python (!)
i don ' t see that there is anything intrinsic about perl or python , as programming languages , that makes them better suited for that domain than haskell .
openbayes for python looks good , so together these would be powerful tools ... but again , this is just my selfish perspective , since i know these languages better than haskell .
bash scripting is more easier then python :) .
bash : sometimes it ' s easier to write a script in bash rather than in python .
however , i have been coding in python enough the past 3 years that it is as easy ( if not easier ) for me to think in python than in bash .
bash is great for interfacing with existing command - line tools ... frequently a single pipe to awk or grep is much easier than the python alternative .
since python supports objects it ' s easier to write complex scripts than with bash .
i use the bourne shell for portability , bash for its greater power than sh ( arrays , etc .), ksh when bash is not available and python when i need speed and greater power than bash .
of course , with greater complexity , it would be cleaner to move the python code to a separate file and strip down the bash function to just : .
running bash scripts is slightly lighter than running perl / python / whatever scripts on top of bash .
sure , if you do nothing but use bash , it might be lighter , but when you use python or perl , you ' re not spawning processes left and right for grep , sed , etc ., the whole toolkit you need to actually get any work done in shell .
python is faster than bash usually , so i think i ' ll just adjust it .
python is about 80 % faster than bash because it is byte compiled while base is interperated .
a simple python script is likely to be faster than anything you can do in bash .
python has good xml parsers , so portage could parse it on its own , probably faster than parsing bash strings .
for 1st , bash was nearly 3 times faster than python .
thats why voted python instead of perl or bash , a gentle introduction to scripting that is useful in more places than just shell or web , and is clear enough to grasp the base concepts .
also the entire menu system is being rewritten ( again ) for the debian base ( using sysvinit rather than upstart ), but this time it ' ll be in python rather than in bash ( which should make it quite a bit faster as well ).
who are you : - you ' ve got five years of experience working at scale , preferably with php - you ' re comfortable with everything from bash scripting to javascript - you ' re a great person - you love making fast websites what you ' ll work with : our base web stack is lamp , but that rides on top of solr / lucene , hadoop , memcache , python , couchbase , open street maps , and more .
i find python easier to program in than bash , you don ' t have to deal with hordes of escaping scenarios , for one .
but any shell script which is longer than 10 lines is already broken and needs to be replaced with a modern , maintainable and readable programming language , such as python ( and many others , even perl is much better than bash in this area ).
python has a simplicity i like , but unfortunately it isn ' t simple to me ( yet ) :)... i ' ll stay focused on bash for a while longer , to try to get a decent intial understanding of it .
python is the only scripting language aside from shell / bash that i use nowadays but i find it can often take longer to hack up a quick little tool in python than it would have to do it in c or java because of getting stuck with some shitty bug in a module .
javascript is better ( imo ) and faster than python .
most javascript interpreters are much faster than nearly all implementations of python .
javascript in v8 executes about ten times faster than python 3 ( shootout . alioth . debian . org / u32 /... ).
though thanks to v8 , it executes javascript faster than php , python and ruby .
otherwise javascript has become amazingly fast , i think v8 is faster then ruby and python .
one thing about javascript being faster than python : one needs to distinguish between a language and its implementation .
in practice , javascript tends to be a lot faster than python , not because of any feature of the languages themselves - they ' re broadly comparable in terms of expressiveness and capabilities - but because companies like microsoft , google , and mozilla have invested heavily in making javascript faster .
also , google ' s open source v8 compiler is so freaking fast , javascript is now reliably faster than java , python , perl , and other interpreted languages .
the use of javascript has lower the barrier for making contributions for gnome desktop , because javascript it ' s a well known language in the web development world an it ' s a easier language to learn than the typical c / c ++ and even python .
python isn ' t pascal but it ' s way better than all the toothless c wannabees that represent the sum total of recent language research , especially javascript , the woodrow wilson of programming languages .
these apps perform surprisingly well , partly because the chrome javascript engine is very fast -- faster than python in some tests -- but also because the chrome apis are fairly thin layers over native os apis .
picking a random benchmark shows v8 ( chrome ' s javascript engine , which is embedded in o3d ) to be 300x faster than python , and i know python is easily fast enough to make a decent game in .
among tools the most efficient and best known tools that uses passive research : wappalazer , it was originally a firefox and chrome extension in javascript , but it was then rewritten in several languages like python .
i want to build a chrome extension which will display a popup when someone highlights a person ' s name ... backend in python myself , i just can ' t do the javascript etc . required to get the extension working .
i ' ve mostly moved on to back - end programming in java , python , and ruby , but i ' m usually very excited to put my javascript boots back on simply because chrome makes it so much fun to work with .
like the talk that i gave on javascript at ' utah js ' went so much better than the one at ' utah open source ' because there were python guys , there were guys who are noobs in that community .
i ' m a python fan , but i ' m not that worked up about the gnome guys picking javascript .
q : there are some guys that i work with , and one of their comments on javascript lately , since i ' ve been wanting to use rhino because i love javascript ... what they brought up is that javascript is becoming a lot like python , and that may or may not be such a great thing .
also , since i know javascript pretty well ( actually better than python ), it might be easier for me to do analysis on the data .
when you are interested in evaluating just one -- known -- javascript function , it may be easier to implement this function in python rather than pull in a huge tool that is built to parse and run all imaginable javascript in the world .
the one by nilesh ( currently accepted ) might work but it is non - python and using elem . get_attribute ( outerhtml ) in python is much easier than unnecessarily invoking javascript .
anecdotally , i ' d say that python code is ( on the surface ) easier to understand than javascript code , making it easier to vote up , although fiddles help your javascript answers because you can prove your code works .
+ oliver zeigermann - while i understand that javascript has many beautiful areas , i ' m myself not a javascript guru and programming in classic oop language with static types ( c #, java , scala ) is easier to me than javascript or ruby , python , etc .
just attempting to generalize our collective experience that writing a moderately complex gui in python , java and flash is so much easier than writing a gui in javascript .
if you are a proficient java programmer but are unfamiliar with python or tcl , you may find it easier to get going writing scripts with javascript or beanshell than you will with jython or jacl , since there is less new ground to cover .
because i found python to be alot more simpler to learn than javascript in many ways .
notice how much cleaner and simpler the python code is compared to the javascript version .
in general , debugging javascript code is not as easy as debugging your python code although firebug has made the problem much simpler already .
so we hit on a simpler hack : we wrote a javascript function to do the fetching and then " hijacked " the raw_input builtin by replacing the interpreter ' s reference to it ( we picked raw_input because the emscripten python interpreter didn ' t implement it anyway ).
python unicode support has always seemed trivial to me , and much better than the other languages i ' ve worked with ( c , php , perl , ruby , javascript , actionscript ).
javascript was one of the first languages i ever learned , but as i drifted more toward python development , i got increasingly out - of - touch with the best ways of doing things .
javascript is even more dynamic than python in many ways , and it ' s seen drastic speedups with primitive first - generation jit compilers , all with no changes to the language ( especially since it ' s standardized .)
this python view server works a bit differently than the default javascript view server in couchdb .
xul ' s native language is ecmascript v3 , aka javascript 1 . 3 , although xul libraries are in the works for python and java .
as python code running in silverlight runs faster than javascript ( and python is a nicer language of course ), you could even use silverlight as an optional accelerator for rias ( rich internet applications ) - falling back to javascript when silverlight is unavailable .
i dont know if you ever coded something in groovy , python or ruby , but i can assure you that its really a better experience than javascript .
java ( or javascript ) code can easily consume , then write the python code .
great javascript , css , and html skills are sometimes harder to find in gis organizations these days than experience with python , c ++, or arcobjects .
javascript / node . js - faster execution than perl , and much easier to write async code .
and i think javascript ( especially on es4 steroids ) is an easier sell than ruby or python to people who like curly braces , which is anyone currently using c ++, java , c #, javascript or perl .
i ' d argue it ' s much easier to write bad code in perl than javascript , but at least it doesn ' t insert semicolons for you .
if you think the javascript was easy to follow , wait until you see the perl scripts that implement the web services ; they ' re even easier to understand and debug .
when i first encountered livescript , i remarked that it ' s like " a smaller language within perl 6 , struggling to get out ..." -- a goal made much easier by focusing strictly on syntactical ergonomics and assuming the same javascript semantics .
i really don ' t like to say that perl is harder than say php or javascript , because i don ' t think its a complete apple to apple ' s comparison , although it is often cast that way .
javascript will likely have a greater impact on the use of cgi / perl than java .
you need to look no further than the developer ' s wiki and search for perl : developer ' s guide afaik , anyways , it ' s easier to develop them using python and javascript .
javascript for example was still considered a toy language in comparison to the mighty perl or asp or php or java .
they say kennedy won because he was better on camera than nixon .
kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates , partly owing to his greater ease before the camera than nixon , who , unlike kennedy , seemed nervous and declined to wear makeup .
" it was like the hot , sweaty nixon all over again ," some are saying , referring to the nixon - kennedy debate in 1960 when richard nixon had a five - o ' clock shadow and perspired profusely on camera .
many voters in 1960 chose the more charismatic john f . kennedy over richard nixon , a man who rarely looked comfortable on camera .
schneider : judy , kennedy won because he looked better than nixon did on television .
kennedy performs better on television than nixon , and it is believed that television helps kennedy win the election .
john f . kennedy understood the power of television better than richard nixon during the race for the presidency in 1960 .
kennedy came across much better on television than the ill , pale , sweating nixon and won the debate and ultimately the presidency .
the nation tuned in for that first debate where senator kennedy famously looked better on black and white television than richard nixon .
i am voting for senator kennedy because i think he ' s a much greater statesman than vice president nixon .
[ 35 ] frank mullin said kennedy better expressed the views of the american public than vice president nixon .
second , the televised debates as the campaign ' s defining events : many journalists and voters judged kennedy to have done better than his republican rival , vice president richard nixon .
the same thing happened many years ago with a younger , more sophisticated , but unknown member of the kennedy clan who looked better in a televised debate than a tired , older , heavily perspiring vice - president named nixon .
richard nixon : vice president nixon won a narrow election over senator john kennedy , of massachusetts .
i hold no candle for richard nixon but the most statesman like thing he ever did , was to concede defeat to jf kennedy ; rather than put the nation through a florida like crisis .
during the 1960 presidential campaign , john f . kennedy got better coverage from the media than did his opponent richard m . nixon .
i was five years old in 1960 and i wanted kennedy to win the presidential election because he was much better looking than nixon .
what mattered on election day for jack kennedy was that he was a much better man and would make a far better president than richard fucking nixon , as later events proved .
kennedy , however , did wear the make - up and so appeared cooler and more composed than nixon .
kennedy was cooler than nixon - actually , nixon in 1968 and 1972 is the exception to this rule , and you know how that turned out .
many have suggested that kennedy ultimately won the 1960 election because he was just easier to look at than richard nixon .
just for the record , i voted for kennedy in the 1968 california democratic primary so i would agree that , by that time , he was better then his opponent , gene mccarthy and certainly far superior to the mentally unstable richard nixon .
if jack kennedy was not a worse person than lyndon johnson or richard nixon , he wasn ' t a better man either .
but those who watched on tv thought that kennedy had won , many said because kennedy simply looked better than nixon , who had been sick in previous days .
a few days later , john f . kennedy was elected over richard nixon .
nine days later , it was john f . kennedy over richard nixon , by about 21 votes .
these days , nixon is held in higher esteem than kennedy only because his misbehavior wasn ' t sexual .
greenberg points to california , which nixon refused to concede until 10 days after the election , when absentee ballots tipped the race in favor of kennedy .
in first grade , he supported john f . kennedy , because he was catholic , like stone , and he had better hair than nixon .
when john f . kennedy appeared before the greater houston ministerial association less than two months before he narrowly defeated richard m . nixon , he effectively neutralized the idea that his religion ( catholicism ) should somehow disqualify him for the nation ' s highest office .
president ever and kennedy is a catholic was challenged in the campaign against richard nixon .
kennedy won over nixon by 113 , 000 votes ( 0 . 1 %) in spite of anti - catholic hatred and bigotry .
my mother had favored richard nixon over john kennedy - despite the fact that she was a catholic .
[ 18 ] although both eisenhower and nixon later claimed that he was merely joking with the reporter , the remark hurt nixon , as it undercut his claims of having greater decision - making experience than kennedy .
the candidate who is expected to do well because of experience and reputation ( douglas , nixon ) must do better than well , while the candidate expected to fare poorly ( lincoln , kennedy ) can put points on the media board simply by surviving .
" " mr . nixon and mr . lodge have more real experience than mr . kennedy and mr . johnson .
from richard reeves ' s " president kennedy ": " ' it was the worst experience of my life ,' kennedy said of the cuban fiasco . . . to , of all people , richard nixon . . . .
sen . everett dirksen gave a speech on why voters should elect richard nixon for president over eventual winner john f . kennedy , pointing to experience .
robinson , it turns out , actually campaigned for nixon in 1960 , in the belief that he would be better for civil rights than kennedy - but not , apparently , better than hubert humphrey , who did not receive the democratic nomination .
nixon was thought to be smarter than kennedy .
or perhaps the example of richard nixon , tricky dick who was considered smarter than kennedy and humphrey .
and all of this , despite the fact that the nixon press operation was far smoother than the kennedy operation .
but kennedy was taking a harder line on cuba than nixon , because kennedy was not aware of the corporate / cia planned invasion .
at first bush , nixon , cabel and hunt decided to just go ahead with the invasion , without informing president kennedy .
he claims nixon was not a drunk , nor was he fraught with guilt over the death of pres kennedy ."
in an attempt to make the electoral college seem even worse than it is , edwards claims that richard nixon received more popular votes in 1960 than john kennedy did .
i also believe the love the press had with kennedy also made matters worse because they more often than not gave kennedy a pass and gave no room to nixon for his personal flaws .
and , when it finally came time for jfk to settle into his presidential candidacy , it seemed that kennedy was forever being given a pass by the elite coastal media , not reporting on ( as nixon called it ) jfk ' s " girling ", or his hanging out with las vegas mobsters , and his family ' s thinly - veiled connection to bootlegging and anti - semitism .
he was feet away when bobby kennedy was assassinated ; in the room when nixon resigned ; with martin luther king , jr . on the meredith march ; and with coretta scott king at her husbandâ €™ s funeral .
still open , though , is the resort ' s wood - paneled ballot room , which is decorated with political articles and cartoons dating back to its first - ever midnight vote : the 1960 general election , when dixville notch went 9 - 0 for richard nixon over john f . kennedy .
hopefully a mouse will decompose quicker than a full sized rat !!

but it ' s no quicker than the 300 - hp cadillac , barely quicker ( by just . 06 sec ) than the 310 - hp audi and slower than the 290 - hp lexus .
the fabric hood of the audi a5 cabriolet is significantly quicker , though , and it can be raised on the move , whereas you have to pull over first in the lexus .

in no way is lexus inferior to bmw / audi / benz 3 .
lexus is inferior to bmw , mb , and audi in the performance segment .
we have had some healthy debate over the past few days and i would like to give some reasons why lexus is inferior to audi , bmw and mercedes benz .
we should say that lexus is inferior , when compared to bmw , mb , and audi when it comes to performance .
the bmw - mercedes benz and now audi have always been superior to lexus .
one commercial , for example , portrays audi as a better alternative to a lexus , mercedes and even a ferrari .
audi joined the top league when it came out with the advertisement which mentioned , audi is growing faster than bmw , lexus & mercedes .
lexus is definitely on par with if not better than mercedes , bmw , or audi .

outhandles a bmw , more reliable than a lexus , better made than a audi , safer than a volvo .
maximum brake testing further betrayed the catera ' s weight with a 60 - to - zero distance of 131 feet ; 6 feet more than a 1999 bmw 328i and 9 feet more than an audi a4 2 . 8 quattro we tested last year , and 17 feet more than a lexus is 300 we tested last month ( all of which are over 400 pounds lighter than the caddy ).
i thought lexus was supposed to be a better value than benz / bmw / audi .
lexus has a better brand value proposition than volvo or infiniti , and reliability is unquestionably higher than the bmw or audi competition .
when it comes to resale values , we expect the 2012 buick verano to offer long - term residual numbers similar to the audi a3 but worse than the lexus is and acura tsx .
i cannot say this mattered to me a great deal , since i keep my cars a long time , and since i expect any resale value on the lexus would have been greater than on the audi , but it is more expensive .
audi holds its value better then a lexus .
it handles better than the lexus and volvo s60r , is faster than both the bmw 3 - series and the audi a4 , and costs thousands of dollars less than all of them .
in a pure performance mode , the lexus rc f really seems to take the cake , a full two seconds faster than the bmw m4 and audi rs 5 .
thats as fast as a bmw 528i , camaro , lexus es300 , se grand am , subaru svx and faster than a acura 3 . 5rl , audi a4 quattro , bmw z3 & 740i , taurus sho and infinity q45 .
at that time , 330 was beated by several competitors ( lexus is350 and infiniti g35 with 300 hp or more ), but it still ran faster in 0 - 60 than many ( mb c350 , audi a4 3 . 2 , jaguar s - type 3 . 0 , ...).
audi is faster than lexus .
lexus needs to get on the ball and offer nicer options from the factory like mercedes is trying to do , bmw and audi have both been ahead of the curve on this .
the lexus rc comes only with a v - 6 , but it doesn ' t feel appreciably faster than the turbocharged cadillac , likely due to the extra weight it ' s lugging around .
the 2007 cadillac xlr is faster than its competitors from mercedes - benz , lexus and jaguar ; and offers fresh , distinctive styling .
the problem was cadillac couldn ' t make the magic after 1980 and the 1985 front drivers were constantly delayed because cadillac realized it was making the wrong car : a tiny , lightweight front wheel drive sedan that was ugly and under powered - when buyers were buying a better engineered , faster , yet more expensive cars from mercedes , then lexus and others .
these days we have the more - green - than - you symbol ( hybrids , electrics , smartcars in the us ), the faster - than - you symbol ( declining , but still there ), the whole array of bigger - than - you symbols ( extended - axle crew - cab xduty pickups , hummer anything , cadillac escalade ), and the persistence of the richer - than - you symbols ( denoted by brands such as lexus at the bottom and increasing up through porsche , and on into the boutique makers ).
the lexus is very nice maybe even nicer than a cadillac ( whole different thread ) but that thread would be a much closer comparison .
this was my first cadillac / domestic car in general , as i am an import type of guy and i would have to say that cadillacs are much nicer than mercedes and lexus ' as far as luxury goes .
the cadillac ats is slightly shorter than the lexus gs 350 , which may make it easier to park .
the problem is gm / cadillac would rather chase after mb and bmw than lexus simply because it is the easier route .
dimensions the cadillac ats is a little narrower than the lexus gs 350 , so you ' ll have an easier time getting in and out of the car in a tight parking spot .
buick wants to chase lexus , than cadillac should chase jaguar / bentley / mercedes .
there ' s lincoln , buick , and cadillac ahead of infiniti , and not too far behind lexus .
i ' ve driven late model buicks and lexus as well as a jaguar to or from florida but if your timing is right , you might luck into a fairly new bmw , cadillac or lincoln , the cars companies like canada driveaway , cars to florida and toronto driveaway may have available .
those buick radios are just a whole lost nicer than the stock cadillac radios .
and japan produced over the years and until the dreaded advent of plastic , many more tinplate models of ford , chrysler , chevrolet , buick , some even nicer than this cadillac .
this is a market that i think lincoln really needs to tap into , especially since they compete more with buick ( and only marginally , since buicks have gotten a lot nicer ) than arch - rival cadillac .
all buick needs is nicer designs - and i think they ' re coming .. but , i think the designs could be even nicer - just it ' s not easy without looking better than cadillac ..
iirc , you got a chevy ( entry level ), then a pontiac ( slightly nicer entry level ), then olds ( more at performance than luxury )/ buick ( more at luxury than performance ), then cadillac ( both luxury and performance ).
should buick survive , it will likely be because the brand has traction in china , where far more buicks are sold than in the u . s . should cadillac be broadened in appeal to attract buick customers , though , it would spell doom for the tri - shield brand .
buick is a much , much bigger seller in china - the chinese seem to prefer the rounded styling of most current buicks to the edgy , expressive design language of the current cadillac model line - up .
it feels like i ' m driving a buick ( which is not necessarily a bad thing , as i find buicks very comfortable ) rather than a cadillac because there ' s nothing in the acceleration or front - wheel drive that allows me to take advantage of the upgraded struts , suspension , and damping !
just as long as they make buick the equivalent or slightly better than what cadillac is now .
the 307 in the buick and olds wouldn ' t set any speed records , but they were faster than the cadillac , way more reliable , and ran forever .
for example , cadillac continues to grow faster than it has been almost 40 years and buick just returned its 14 th consecutive month of higher retail sales versus the prior year .
cadillac will be able to command a higher price than buick would be able to , thus helping to pay off development costs of teh voltec and allow gm to lower the prices for this technology faster .
buick has tried to separate itself from the 50s something crowd , but the likes of faster rompers that offer more in the glean of luxuriousness married to sexiness , like the cts by cadillac , has left them positioned mostly to the asian - pacific market in recent years .
notably , buick earned a higher average road - test score than cadillac but was hurt by weak reliability .
in 1940 , buick had a higher horsepower engine than the cadillac at 141 horsepower vs . cadillac ' s 140 .
as most of you may know in china the " buick " name plate actually holds a slightly higher status than does cadillac .
cadillac has sharper lines , appealing to an edgier personality than softer and smoother buick .
but i can ' t say whether a buick with mr would still be a bit softer than a cadillac with mr , only for the sake of it still being a buick .
a buick lacrosse is a lot more vehicle for the money than a cadillac ats , too , but only if you want a bigger , softer , floatier , highway - bound sedan .
although it ' s my understanding that the chinese don ' t like the cadillac design language with all the angles and creases , rather they prefer the softer , rounded shapes that buick uses .
gm was the worst because then had to make a cadillac better than an oldsmobile , which was better than a buick , which was better than a pontiac , which was better than a chevy .
i also remember cadillacs of this vintage would show rust rather quickly - they weren ' t better than an oldsmobile or buick in that regard .
devoted import - intenders believe the lincoln town car and the cadillac deville are stodgy - looking , sloppy - handling , underperforming tugboats : fitted with interior bits and features barely better than those in their platform - sharing siblings at ford and mercury , or oldsmobile , pontiac , and buick .
still , though cadillac sales were flat last year at 235 , 000 cars , it ' s in better shape than , say , pontiac , buick , or saturn .
the model overlap is to close together to make a cadillac better than a buick , buick better than chevy ... .
buick automobiles are in the middle , as well , of the general motors lineup , above the mainstream chevrolet and below the luxury cadillac nameplate .
according to cadillac , the escalade records about 13 - per - cent better highway fuel consumption than the mercedes - benz gl550 and almost 17 - per - cent greater than the lexus lx 570 and land rover range rover .
finally , one thing not mentioned in the review that i saw in person was the incredible 2nd row leg room ... better than the cadillac and considerably greater than the lexus .... which sacrificed 2nd row legroom for the 3rd row .
cadillac says that the escalade ' s epa highway rating of 21 mpg is 17 percent higher than that of the previous model , and significantly better than that of either the mercedes - benz gl550 or lexus lx 570 .
i don ' t really think lexus is looked at as higher class than cadillac .
cadillac , lincoln and jaguar all score higher than mb , along with the usual suspects , lexus , infiniti , toyota , honda , etc .: .
those numbers , cadillac points out , are better than the horsepower and torque numbers for comparable v6 engines driving such competitive vehicles as the mercedes - benz e - class and the lexus es 350 .
the cadillac srx has a little more horsepower than the lexus rx 350 .
in contrast , cadillac doesn ' t need cost savings , it need vehicles that are significantly better than those made by lexus , audi , bmw and mercedes .
my best analogy to the article is : cadillac is better than lexus because they sold more vehicles in the us we all know that the conclusion doesn ' t fit the statement because of several factors ( cost , availability , etc ).
the brand new cadillac srx is designed to compete against import vehicles like the lexus rx .
my dad bought a cadillac suv which he now said sucks compared to the comparable priced audi suv and nothing rides smoother and quieter than a full size lexus .
and cadillac currently has the momentum to be better than bmw , let alone lexus .
hands down , the cadillac dts offers better fuel economy and price than a lexus 430 .
so how you came to the conclusion that the equus isn ' t as refined as a cadillac but would be as refined as a lexus is beyond comprehension .

previously , the company was using slower ssds in airs from toshiba , but switched to newer chips from samsung in april of this year .
in comparing the three tvs , the newer lg and toshiba models had comparable contrast , and both models showed improvement over the first - gen samsung .
the samsung drives are slightly faster than the toshiba drives .

the toshiba bits that are inside my air , from october , are actually slower than those in the latest batch , which house an ssd blade from samsung .

weak memory chip prices remain the biggest concern for samsung in the third quarter , but it will again fare better than rivals as its reliance on apple , which tends to squeeze suppliers quite a bit , is small compared to the likes of hynix and toshiba .

the company ' s investors include samsung electronics , an even bigger flash - memory supplier than toshiba .

while hd - dvd won the first round earlier this year -- its toshiba hd - a1 and most hd - dvd movies definitely looked better than did the initial blu - ray player , the samsung bd - p1000 , and its accompanying blu - ray movies -- the difference between the two formats is disappearing quickly .
toshiba , another manufacturer of nand flash chips , also shifted to 32nm manufacturing process earlier this year and even they faced some transition problems but unlike samsung , toshiba were quick to solve their problems .

toshiba and seagate share the second spot , and samsung falls behind because of its higher power consumption at peak streaming reads .

we were interested in toshiba after we saw that toshiba was better than samsung because it had clear picture and extreme sound .
i have seen it from my own eyes the picture on the toshiba is way better than the samsung !

i ' ve got a toshiba 37 1080p in the front room which was more than twice the price and the picture is better on the samsung , sound is also better , really slim design .
i think the toshiba still presents a slightly sharper picture overall when compared to the samsung .
my $ 2000 samsung 3d led tv has worse sound than my 30 - year old toshiba 25 clunker because the speakers face the brick wall behind it .
it ' s the same processor as in the toshiba satellite u50t , and a better - sounding proposition than the low - power amd a6 parts inside the samsung and asus laptops - although it may face a stiffer test when up against the lenovo ' s beefy amd a10 apu .
the toshiba sound is much crisper than the rather touching bakelite fuzz of the samsung , too .
design toshiba makes much of the at200 ' s thinness , and rightly so : at 7 . 7mm it ' s slimmer than the samsung galaxy tab 10 . 1 ( 8 . 6mm ) and the ' new ' ipad ( 9 . 4mm ), although there ' s every likelihood that something thinner will appear before long and steal its thunder .
a weaker yen also gives toshiba an advantage over rivals such as samsung and sk hynix in south korea .
