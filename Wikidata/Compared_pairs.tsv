compsci	JavaScript	Perl			Is JavaScript faster than Perl? For some tasks, yes. For others, Perl is faster. In the linked benchmark shootout, Node.js beat Perl (often by a wide margin) in 8 out of 10 benchmarks. However, this ignores a vital difference between the languages. Perl has a method (the Inline module) that allows us to include C functions right inside our Perl script. You can write node.js extensions in c++ but these are external modules that have to be compiled seperately. With Inline C in perl you can mix C and Perl source code in the same file; compilation is automatic and transparent.		https://www.quora.com/Is-JavaScript-faster-than-Perl
compsci	Windows 8	Windows 7			Windows 8 lasted less than 48 hours on my desktop before I reverted to 7. It was an incredibly short-sighted decision to force a touch-friendly interface on my entirely non-touch desktop system. And the “return of the Windows button” bringing up that same screen full of tiles in 8.1 did not impress me either. I think the best operating system shipped out of Redmond would have to be Windows 7. Here’s why: Instead of having the majority of settings available from the Control Panel, some have shifted to the Settings app while others remained where they were. I still don’t see the logic in that move. Microsoft is working hard to remove the personal from personal computer. Users have far less control of their own systems than was possible with previous versions.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-favorite-Microsoft-Windows-version-in-history
compsci	Scala	Java			I have limited experience with Scala on Android in combination with libGDX library. I must say that setting up environment is much more difficult compared to Java. If you want to support older versions of Android you'll need to use some way of circumventing older Android's VM limits (number of classes), because Scala's basic library is huge.	?	https://www.quora.com/Are-there-drawbacks-in-developing-for-mobile-in-Scala-vs-in-Java-in-2014
compsci	Swift	Objective-C			Learning Objective-C is a little bit harder to learn. But Objective-C is all C - check the headers. I love C and using Objective-C as my desired programming language. There are a lot of programming books in C. So if you tend to stay into programming for a long time, I recommend learning C. I don’t believed what some people are saying that programmers stay from 50–60hours work week. So if you’re not fully prepared in doing some coding, expect long hours.		https://www.quora.com/Is-Swift-more-popular-than-Objective-C
compsci	PHP	Java			It isn't correct to compare Java to PHP. Since PHP is a server-side scripting language whereas Java is a general-purpose language. In other words, PHP is only used as a server-side language where Java is both for the server-side and desktop programming language. Moreover, Java is compiled and strongly-typed language. On another hand, PHP is a dynamically typed language. Hence, only for server-side programming, the comparison between Java and PHP makes sense.		https://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-the-best-programming-language-Java-or-PHP

compsci	Ruby	Python			If you’re new to this and just getting started, there’s no wrong answer here, but I would advise you to start with a smaller project that has a realistic completion and end-state (e.g. “I’m going to make a TODO app” or “I’m going to make a website that manages my bookmarks.”, and not “I’m going to make a new Social Media platform that’s going to be a game-changer and it’s going to make me money.” don’t do that.) As a side-note, scripting languages such as Python and Ruby tend to be a little easier to pickup than compiled languages because you can tinker with them a bit more easily. (Compiled languages would have you write the source, then compile it, then run it. You can step through it with a debugger, but you can’t jump into the interpreter command-line and just try stuff out like you can with Python or Ruby)	?	https://www.quora.com/Which-should-I-choose-Python-or-Ruby
compsci	Java	Perl			Perl is still a very useful language, and has a vibrant community releasing major and minor upgrades multiple times per year. There are more Perl programmers today than during the first dot-com boom. It’s just a smaller piece of a much bigger pie. The biggest problem Perl faces is that managers can’t find enough Perl people to hire. The kids all want the latest cool languages, believing Perl is past its prime. This unfortunately influences some managers to abandon Perl, because they can’t find anyone. Sad.		https://www.quora.com/Have-you-worked-on-a-Perl-script-in-2019-where-Python-Java-Go-and-other-alternatives-are-widely-available
compsci	Python	Java			Python better for short programs/prototyping, Java better for big projects/mission-critical stuff. Details follow. I use both Python and Java on a daily basis, mixing and matching as the needs require. Increasingly my workflow is prototype in Python, then migrate to Java once we've got the design right, worked out the kinks. Python is much quicker to prototype in. Things like the functional programming, lists as first-order primitives, tuple return values, "duck" typing and the fact that the console is available for debugging easily and testing quickly really give it an edge. Python is my "1000-line" language -- it's what I use for projects that expect to be around 1000 lines long. It works well for procedural tasks. It is also very concise. However, Python doesn't scale as well as Java for large projects. Java is my "100,000-line" programming language: what I used for complicated data structures, mission critical services, etc. Its static typing really makes it more manageable at large code scales; or where you are building "toolkits" that need to be re-used to implement a wide range of functionality, or across many applications. With Python, you'll get AttritbuteError: None, and not know exactly what to do with it.		https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-Python-vs-Java
compsci	Windows XP	Windows 98			So many answers. Firstly, Windows 98 is an MS DOS based, emulated 32Bit OS. Windows XP is the real McCoy. It is based on Windows NT. Windows 98 SE uses FAT32 and has a partition size limit of 127GB (or 137GB depending on how you count kb). Networking is possible, but it doesn’t have the benefits and security of an NT-based system; the RAM limit is 2GB (in fact, even the 32 bit Windows 10 has a limit of 4GB of RAM as opposed to the 64 bit, which can have up to 512 GB); Windows 98, because of the limitations of the FAT system, does not support files larger than 2GB; and many more differences. The point is that Windows 95, 98, and 98SE were great in their times, and opened doors to what we have today. Windows XP (SP3) was the longest living OS ever. People still ask questions about it, but none compares to Windows 95 in 1995. That was when the “revolution” started.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Windows-98-and-XP
compsci	JavaScript	PHP			Regarding the functionalities, PHP is a server-side language so you can: Access server resources (if allowed by the server) like memory, CPU, time, CURL, etc. Access filesystem (read, write, copy, move, delete, etc). Interact with Database. Keep your source files invisible. Deny users to control the output using 3rdParties like firebug. Even control JavaScript outputs. Control the output headers.	?	https://www.quora.com/What-can-PHP-do-that-JavaScript-cant
compsci	Ethernet	USB			You could safely say Ethernet is faster than USB since that's true most of the time. Ethernet links have reached speeds of 100Gbps and are marching towards 400G and higher add technology improves. Ethernet also supports aggregating multiple links into a bundle to give arbitrarily high bandwidths. USB seems to have a max of ~5Gbps, nowhere close to Ethernet.		https://www.quora.com/Which-is-faster-USB-or-Ethernet
compsci	PostgreSQL	Oracle			I think the main difference lies in the consequent enterprise orientation of Oracle - they developed additional functionality which is extremely practical for enterprise users, e.g. flashback, in-memory features, optimizer plan stability, LDAP integration. database file encryption, performace views for monitoring, materialized views, result caching, transaction handling in PL/SQL etc. I know, a lot of these features are somehow also available in PostgreSQL, e.g. if you use additional modules, but Oracle delivers them as one neat, integrated package. If you happen to need the enterprise features, then a migration might be painful.		https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-migrating-from-Oracle-11g-to-PostgreSQL
compsci	MySQL	SQLite			SQLite is a public domain, open-source project. It is what is called an “embedded” database which means the DB engine runs as part of your app. MySQL is also open-source but is owned by Oracle. MySQL is a database server so you have to install it somewhere and then connect to it from your app.  SQLite is often used for an app to maintain its own data. For example, a web browser might use SQLite to store its bookmarks. A database server such as MySQL is used to store data that is typically accessed by multiple users and apps.		https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-SQLite-and-MySQL-Are-they-both-the-same-company
compsci	Smalltalk	Java			One of the differences is that Java is statically-typed while Smalltalk is dynamically-typed. This means that in Java, every variable and every expression in the language, has a type that is determined at compile time, and this static type determines what the compiler will let you do. In Smalltalk, there is no static type. Another difference that is related to the above is that in Java, a method call expression or field access expression is only allowed if that field or method is provided by the static type of the expression to the left.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Smalltalk-and-Java
compsci	Haskell	Java			The two languages present entirely different ways of programming (OOP vs FP). Java’s ecosystem is much larger and richer. Java is much more versatile. So it rather depends on the type of application you’re writing. Haskell compiles to native code, while Java runs on a byte-code virtual machine.		https://www.quora.com/Can-we-use-Haskell-in-place-of-Java-If-so-will-it-improve-the-performance-of-the-application
compsci	Groovy	Java			Since Java 8 introduced lambda expressions and a degree of functional programming is possible, Groovy is however less interesting. The Groovy author is quoted that if he knew about Scala, he would not have started a new language.		https://www.quora.com/When-is-Groovy-preferred-over-Java
compsci	Java	Lisp			Java is an object-oriented programming language that focuses on providing all the high-level features needed to work on AI projects, it's portable, and it offers in-built garbage collection. The Java community is also a plus point as there will be someone to help you with your queries and problems. Java is also a good choice as it offers an easy way to code algorithms, and AI is full of algorithms, be they search algorithms, natural language processing algorithms or neural networks. Not to mention that Java also allows for scalability, which is a must-have feature for AI projects. Lisp fares well in the AI field because of its excellent prototyping capabilities and its support for symbolic expressions. It's a powerful programming language and is used in major AI projects, such as Macsyma, DART, and CYC.		https://www.quora.com/Which-language-Python-R-Java-C-or-Lisp-is-best-to-learn-artificial-intelligence
compsci	PHP	Python			PHP has grown up over the years to a very powerful language. PHP is a server side language which means it's strength is is the backend processing that it can do. Python is a scripting language that was designed to work on a Linux platform. Because it is so flexible, people have made web servers for it but its still not a web server by design.		https://www.quora.com/PHP-vs-Ruby-Python-and-Javascript
compsci	Python	Bash			Bash is necessary for general interaction with the kernel. If it didn't exist,would be necessary to invent it. It is great for automating many tasks, coupled with many other Linux programs like sed ,awk, find, grep etc. However, since bash is not inherently object oriented, nor terribly structured, Python is a better choice for larger programs, easier to understand., etc. Also , one can can create graphical programs in Python . This is not commonly done in bash	?	https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-for-Linux-Bash-or-Python
compsci	Python	Perl			Python does not trust the programmer to write a readable code, and limits the language in places where people may misunderstand code. The most extreme example is with “indentation as part of the syntax”. Perl prefers to give the programmer as much as possible syntactic choices, in the hopes that it will result in a readable, or shorter, code. That’s why so much perl code out-there looks like random garbage		https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-basic-difference-between-Python-vs-Perl
compsci	Eclipse	NetBeans			Probably the biggest difference that will affect you, between Eclipse and NetBeans, is the way they manage projects. Eclipse invented their own concept of what a “project” is, and build tools such as Make, Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. have to be shoehorned into that. This is what makes using something like Maven in Eclipse painful. With NetBeans, we made a very conscious decision to use existing build tools’ metadata as NetBeans projects. So if a folder has a build file in it, it simply is a project. If you’re just learning programming, that won’t affect you much. But if you’re working professionally, on existing projects and other people’s code, it makes a huge difference		https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-Eclipse-or-NetBeans-Why
compsci	CUDA	OpenCL			Currently CUDA is more efficient in terms of development cost and execution time since it has more uniform structure with its unique CUDA devices and environment. OpenCL tries to keep up all the GPU devices thus their doing is even longer for all the configuration needs and the execution time is relatively more costly. I suggest to go with CUDA if you have compatible device otherwise the only choice is OpenCL.		https://www.quora.com/Parallel-Computing-CUDA-vs-OpenCL-what-is-the-most-efficient
compsci	MySQL	Oracle			The difference is that MySQL is free, and the world's most popular database, and Oracle isn't free (except with trials and certain products) and makes billions from selling premium database software to large enterprises and SME.		https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-Oracle-and-MySQL
compsci	Python	Lisp			Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the AI field of Artificial Intelligence thanks to its simplicity. It can seamlessly be used with the data structures and other frequently used AI algorithms. Lisp fares well in the AI field because of its excellent prototyping capabilities and its support for symbolic expressions. It's a powerful programming language and is used in major AI projects, such as Macsyma, DART, and CYC.		https://www.quora.com/Which-language-Python-R-Java-C-or-Lisp-is-best-to-learn-artificial-intelligence
compsci	Java	Scala			The fact that you have more Java developers than Scala developers is of secondary importance, because, as my experience suggests, any decent Java developer can learn enough Scala to start working with it professionally in about a week. The same goes for high load requirements. Scala can easily handle the same load; the only important difference is that Java is suited better for writing low-level code with predictable GC-pauses.		https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-choose-Java-vs-Scala-and-Spring-vs-Akka-on-a-microservice-level
compsci	Ruby	PHP			If you need rapid development, then i would suggest not to use PHP. Handling PHP code gets difficult as your project grows and specially if more than one person is coding it. Python is used by software developers, scientific computing people and also internet based app developers.		https://www.quora.com/Choosing-a-web-development-technology-PHP-Ruby-Python
compsci	JavaScript	Python			Python has a lot going for it, including the fact that it is almost ubiquitous, has innumerable libraries and massive communities and these are all things that Javascript also has.Javascript, granted, has more tedious syntax, but by forcing the programmer to use curly braces around blocks, there is no question about what code belongs to a block. But Javascript has another thing going for it, which is the way the runtime manages execution of code in an asynchronous manner. The asynchronous abilities of Javascript lead to some hair-raising code, but it has allowed people to write some of the most responsive server applications.		https://www.quora.com/What-programming-language-do-you-consider-to-be-easier-or-simpler-JavaScript-or-Python
compsci	Ruby	Java			One benefit of learning Java over Ruby is that Java opens up more doors for you. There are multiple JVM languages and many companies choose another JVM language over Java. I used to be a Java developer, but I’m now a Scala, which is a JVM language, developer. If you have a decent understanding of Java and JVM, it’s easier to learn another JVM language. Actually, Java is inevitable if you are writing in one of the JVM languages. You need to know Java at least a little bit.		https://www.quora.com/Ruby-vs-Java-What-language-do-you-feel-would-be-most-beneficial-to-learn-and-why
compsci	Sed	AWK			sed was built for and is used for one thing - editing lines on a per-line basis given an instruction. AWK can do that, as well as run complete programs, as it is a full Programming Language.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Sed-and-AWK-in-Linux
compsci	Windows Vista	Windows XP			1 - Appearance in Vista is very beautiful and easy to use either in the appearance of the system is very normal XP, but you can change it. 2 - Windows Vista system when installed on the device, it reserves more than 40 gigabytes of hard disk space (internal scanner for the computer) The system xp only 6 GB of hard disk space.		https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Windows-Vista-better-than-Windows-XP
compsci	Integer	Floating-point			You use Integers to store numbers like 1,2,3 or -1,-2 as the name implies integers. And floating numbers to store floating values like 2.3.		https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-these-data-types-integer-floating-point-string-and-boolean
compsci	OpenGL	Direct3D			The first reason is performance. OpenGL was a little bit slower than Direct3D around me in 1997~2000. Most game developers was needed to write best performing code for slow computers, so Direct3D was the best choice. At first glance, Direct3D was more complex than OpenGL, but Direct3D allowed app developers to directly access 3D resources (mesh and texture buffer). Another reason is that there were many Direct3D resources for graphics techniques. Microsoft, Nvidia and ATI has released many beautiful techniques and samples.		https://www.quora.com/Why-do-developers-often-choose-Direct3D-over-OpenGL
brands	Chrysler	Toyota			Toyota has been on the top of the reliability lists for many years, Chrysler products typically occupy the lower regions of the same lists.		https://www.quora.com/Are-Toyota-vehicles-statistically-more-reliable-than-Chrysler-cars
brands	Toyota	Honda			In terms of comfort Toyota is far superior than any car in the industry be it the driver or the passengers there is no match for Innova. Honda city on the other hand is superb in driving. It’s steering is so light that anyone can drive it with ease. There is no engine sound at idling. Super smooth ride and you reach in comfort to your destination. Long drives for the passengers is not as good as Innova though. Overall to sum up both are amazing brands super reliable, great resale value for both brands. Service cost is comparable to any car in the segment. To decide between one of the two is a difficult decision as both the brands are of amazing quality.		https://www.quora.com/Which-is-a-more-reliable-brand-Toyota-or-Honda
brands	Leica	Nikon			The Leica, and this is true of all mirrorless cameras, benefits from mechanical simplicity, hence lighter weight, and bringing the lens closer to the focal plane of the shutter, impossible with a mirror in the road of it, permits simpler lens design, especially physically smaller lenses, for the same f stop, in turn permitting Leica to attain extraordinarily high manufacturing standards. A physically small lens permits higher sophistication and higher manufacturing standards. Nikon, on the other hand, makes cameras that are of excellent quality, and a lot cheaper, although not of the absolute quality of Leica. Leica, though, does hold its value much better.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-performance-difference-between-a-Nikon-and-a-Leica-camera
brands	Nissan	Honda			Honda’a -Known for being extremely reliable aside from some transmission issues that I believe have been corrected for some time now. Nissan’s - Known to be reliable and that’s pretty well as much as you can say positive and truthful being they’ve had so many issues with they’re 2.5 engines and the transmissions they put in several of they’re trucks & SUVs that had a problem getting coolant into the fluid.		https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Toyota-and-Honda-more-popular-than-Nissan
brands	Amazon	Microsoft			Microsoft has fewer opportunities in its core market than Amazon. While productivity software - and some hardware - is a large and growing market, it is smaller than retail. Both have great opportunities in Cloud Services. The two companies have vastly different core expertise, and I would expect Microsoft to have better AI capabilities, but Amazon to have a richer array of use cases for AI application. Microsoft has greater experience selling to large enterprises than Amazon does.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-Microsoft-has-that-Amazon-doesn-t
brands	Apple	Google			Google.  Here's why: Cloud services are increasingly important.  We put more and more things in the cloud.  Phones and tablets and other devices are simply becoming portals to the services that we use everyday.  The king of those services is Google, and Apple is far behind.  Another reason Google will "win", is because of Android.  Lots of new connected devices run Android.  It's easy to port to smaller devices.  Android runs on Google Glass, and surely any other wearable device that Google comes out with.		https://www.quora.com/Who-will-win-Google-or-Apple
brands	Honda	Toyota			Generally, Toyota lasts longer, should give you less problems, should be cheaper, can work with the generic purpose oils you get in the market and can go on tough (non-first class) roads. Honda will be more expensive to run and maintain (you need specific oils in the engine), the spare parts will be more expensive, is a little more likely to produce faults and even more likely to get hurt on tough roads.		https://www.quora.com/Which-is-a-more-reliable-brand-Toyota-or-Honda
brands	Nvidia	MSI			Nvidia is a GPU chip designer, while MSI is a graphics card manufacturer. MSI also makes other products like motherboards, laptops, PCs and peripherals. Nvidia only makes the founder’s edition or ‘reference’ model of a GPU.		https://www.quora.com/Are-Nvidia-and-MSI-the-same-company
brands	IBM	Hewlett-Packard			I would say that IBM invests way more in innovation, patent development and "blue sky" thinking. A good recent example of this is the Watson supercomputer. HP has been sidetracked with the EDS acquisition and merging of two very different cultures whereas IBM acquisitions are very quickly blue-rinsed and staff assimilated into IBM's culture. IBM management in countries outside of the US also have a lot more autonomy than at HP where the MD is largely a figurehead.		https://www.quora.com/Why-is-IBM-so-good-at-what-it-does-Why-does-HP-want-to-emulate-IBM-Why-does-Dell-think-they-can-be-better-than-both-Do-you-think-either-company-passing-IBM-is-even-possible

brands	Nikon	Sigma			While some people experienced some quality control issues with a few early Sigma lenses, the same can be said about early Nikon lenses. But over the last twenty years or so, the quality of Sigma lenses has greatly improved, to the point where their best lenses are the equal to the best Nikon lenses for the most part, with very few exceptions. And even in those few cases, Sigma beats Nikon prices by an often considerable margin.		https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-quality-differences-between-Sigma-lenses-and-Nikon-Lenses
brands	Microsoft	IBM			IBM is a joke. It used to be a pioneer in many things long back but not now. The company is losing profits and getting on the path to bankruptcy. None of its products are doing well. They are only surviving because of the service industry. Microsoft on the other hand is an amazing company worth working for. They have such diverse products and portfolio that there is no scope of it going down. They have cloud, os, applications in all segments, what not.

HP is the same.		https://www.quora.com/Currently-I-am-in-last-year-of-ECE-from-local-engineering-college-how-can-I-get-placed-in-big-organisation-like-HP-INTEL-etc
brands	Asus	Gigabyte			With ASUS I had some annoying problems in attaining the right driver for a specific card, their servers with information are all over the place, but their server holding the drivers was just in Asia. Gigabyte went as far to create a custom bios for me.		https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-make-brand-of-GPU-imply-or-differ-i-e-Gigabyte-ASUS-MSI
brands	Sigma	Nikon			Sigma's new Art series lenses are worth buying over nikon because they give you better detail, colors and more crisp image quality than Nikon. Moreover, Sigma lenses are cheaper as compared to nikon or canon lenses. I have used both sigma and nikon, and sigma has given me exactly what I wanted. Even the auto focus in Sigma(A) is faster than Nikon's.		https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-quality-differences-between-Sigma-lenses-and-Nikon-Lenses
jbt	psp	ds			Well basically because the Nintendo DS was a better console overall. It had 2 screens that that opened up for a lot of new types of games. One of the screens was a touch screen that opened up for a lot of new cool games. So functionality wise it could do a lot more. This also allowed for more or less every game on the PSP to be ported over to the Nintendo DS but most of the unique games on the Nintendo DS just couldn’t work on the PSP because it hadn’t the necessary tech.		https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-PSP-less-popular-than-the-Nintendo-ds
jbt	baseball	basketball			I would say basketball is more famous than baseball, solely based on the fact that I have heard, played and seen a lot more of basketball that baseball. Baseball is not as famous as basketball outside USA. One of the major factor of this is the size of the fields. Basketball only required 2 hoops and 495.6377184 sq. m of area whereas a baseball field has to be 12140.60 sq. m. So, it is way easier to finance and build or make area for a basketball court than a baseball field. Basketball is also an indoor sport whereas baseball is not, therefore, in countries with cold winters, basketball is generally preferred over baseball.		https://www.quora.com/Is-basketball-more-popular-than-baseball

jbt	mit	harvard			All that matters is what is a better match for you as a person. MIT if you’re going for pretty much any STEM related field. Harvard, if you’re heading for an MBA & Wall Street, or law school, or politics, or the humanities. MIT is a warm, welcoming place with friendly, like minded people from similar background of yourself. It is great, but it is also a bit of a protective bubble. Harvard in general challenges you a little bit more to figure out who you are and what you really want. You will meet more different types of people (both in a good or bad way). Besides, Harvard is going to be cheaper if you need financial aid.		https://www.quora.com/MIT-vs-Harvard-Which-university-is-better-for-undergraduate-studies-if-money-is-not-a-problem
jbt	virginia	california			I’d say Virginia is a great place for a family. Affordable housing (compared to California, anyway), and lots of things to do and places to go. There are several excellent elementary schools but the middle and high schools are admittedly not the best. Unfortunately, the job market isn't as hot as it is in California. Considering the climate, the dry heat of California and the surrounding desert states is much more comfortable than the humidity on the East Coast, but the benefit of that is there are four distinct seasons in Virginia. 		https://www.quora.com/What-if-I-move-with-my-family-from-California-to-Richmond-Virginia-Is-Virginia-a-good-place-for-a-family
jbt	youtube	itunes			Apple is much closer to Netflix than YouTube today, since YouTube has just launched their paid model in a real way and Apple has been doing it for a while now. iTunes has an affiliate program, while YouTube doesn't.

jbt	harvard	cornell			Academically at the undergraduate level, Cornell and Harvard are the same. Egos are big at any top-tier school, but I think they’re bigger at Harvard. Harward is infamous for stress ingeneral. Engineering at Cornell is stronger than Engineering at Harvard.  Harvard would win in the liberal arts in general, but Cornell has great research and engineering opportunities. Also, Cornell is famous for interdisciplinary program among colleges within the University. The quality of your education, whether it's in Harvard or Cornell, comes down mainly to the choices you make and the opportunities you take.		https://www.quora.com/Which-university-is-most-stressful-for-undergraduate-Harvard-vs-MIT-vs-Yale-vs-Stanford-vs-UPenn-vs-Cornell, https://www.quora.com/Why-would-someone-choose-Cornell-over-Harvard, https://www.quora.com/Academically-how-big-of-a-gap-is-there-between-Cornell-and-Harvard

jbt	fishing	skiing			what is fun about fishing? just about everything from choosing rods, reels, etc, to learning new techniques, to planning fishing trips and jetting off to far flung places. Being outdoors in beautiful countryside. Pitting yourself against quarry in its own element, fighting it on rod and line, successfully landing it and then respectfully releasing it. It’s nice to get some action in nature during the winter months. Skiing, on the other hand, has its strong points. Skiing is the closest thing to flying. It is spiritual. It is a healthy activity. It is a wonderful activity to share with others. It brings us close to nature. It is simply fun.		https://www.quora.com/Why-do-you-like-fishing, https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-appeal-of-skiing
jbt	timber	lumber			The word lumber is not used outside North America. Timber is timber, the US refers to timber as lumber.  In the US this is how it is summarised. Timber is dominantly considered as the wood that is still attached to the ground whereas lumber is no longer standing on the ground. Timber is widely accepted as the wood with its bark still on whereas lumber no longer has the wooden bark. Timber is the word used to refer to wooden boards in the U.K. and Australia while lumber is the wooden board for the American and Canadian denomination. According to North America, lumber is the finished wood product often made commercially available especially in construction whereas timber still has to be cut and processed for it to be sold for construction purposes.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-timber-and-lumber
jbt	football	basketball			Soccer is more challenging than basketball because using your feet is much more complicated and difficult than using your hands. Soccer requires you to be more fit. It has greater skill and greater difficulty level. A seven footer with poor skills can manage to play basketball purely on the basis of his physical gifts. No such chance in soccer. Soccer is played by 11 players as compared to 5 in basketball. Coordination is far more difficult and it is more of a team game.		https://www.quora.com/Is-soccer-more-tiring-than-basketball, https://www.quora.com/Which-sport-is-better-basketball-or-football
jbt	soda	juice			Soda made from cane sugar and naturally fermented is pretty amazing. Root beer is awesome. Orange pineapple strawberry juice is pretty cool, too. Both are sugar filled and incredibly unhealthy for you though. They also both are linked to diabetes and weight gain. But juice is always healthier than soda. Soda is just carbonated water which does not have any health benefits rather have side effects. On the other hand fresh juice is power-packed with nutrients which at least is the value addition.		https://www.quora.com/Which-do-you-like-better-juice-or-soda, https://www.quora.com/Are-fruit-juices-actually-healthier-than-soda

jbt	harvard	dartmouth			If cost is a concern and Dartmouth is significantly cheaper than HYP then go to Dartmouth. If you don’t care about prestige, good weather, renowned professors and ambitious peers, then consider Dartmouth. Dartmouth is more differentiable from Harvard than from Yale and Princeton. Dartmouth is more focused on undergrads than Harvard if that matters to you.		https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-reasons-to-attend-Dartmouth-rather-than-a-top-tier-Ivy-such-as-Harvard-Yale-or-Princeton
jbt	potato	steak			Steak and potatoes go together like bread and butter so it’s impossible to compare the two when they are made for each other, however, if you’re dieting and want to look after your health better, then the potato would win over the potato, even though it’s classed as a starch and had very little nutritional values.		https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-steak-or-potatoes
jbt	beer	cider			It’s entirely subjective. Cider’s great for those that want a fruitier taste, but not as fruity as a cocktail. Of course, there are several beers that have a citrus taste if that’s what you’re after. Usually, they’re wheat or sour beers. Also, beer (and even cider) has countless varieties so it’s hard to say one definitely tastes better than the other.		https://www.quora.com/Do-you-prefer-beer-or-cider-Why
jbt	phone	laptop			Battery of phones last around 5 hours or straight of using, cheap phone batteries cost around 2–3 or if the non-cheap phone is running so many apps.

jbt	mit	stanford			MIT is more intense. You will find out all the gears you have and discover your limitations by constantly trying to exceed them, and also discover they are different than what you thought. Stanford has a much better climate.		https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-student-at-MIT-vs-Stanford-University

jbt	pasta	pizza			At every pizza/pasta buffet style restaurant I’ve gone to, people eat more pizza than pasta. That must mean they like the taste of the pizza over the pasta. However, another part of the equation is that the pizza comes in all kinds of toppings and cheese, whereas the pasta offerings are usually limited to spaghetti, maybe something like sea shells, possibly lasagna, but that’s about it.		https://www.quora.com/Which-tastes-better-pasta-or-pizza

jbt	tea	soda			For the sake of your health choose green tea. Just because diet drinks don’t have sugar it doesn’t mean they’re healthy, they’re disasters to your health because the artificial sweeteners are extremely toxic (they wreck your brain and heart) and the containers they’re kept in expose the substance to a lot of metal and plastic contamination.		https://www.quora.com/Should-I-order-diet-soda-or-green-tea
jbt	CNN	Fox			CNN defines itself as a News Channel. Fox defines itself as an entertainment channel that also has a news component. It is always important to check multiple news sources, however.

jbt	princeton	harvard			Harvard is the school of innovation. People here are focused on changing the world through the formulation and realization of ideas. Regardless of the discipline, they focus on academic research and discovery that affects the big picture and addresses global problems.  Princeton is the school of intellectual genius. It’s a very self-contained campus, and the lack of professional schools plus the strength of humanities and natural science departments indicates a focus on knowledge and understanding in its purest form.		https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-Harvard-Princeton-or-Yale
